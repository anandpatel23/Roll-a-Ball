# Roll-a-Ball

## First Unity Game

This is my first game using Unity 5. I have no experience with game development, so I was able to utilize unity.com/learn for the first tutorial. 

The game is simple. The user uses the directional keys to move the player object (in this case, a sphere). They need to collide with the collectibles to retrieve all the points to win. 

Once all of the collectibles have been taken, the "You win!" text will be displayed.

*As of 11/4/15, this is in preparation for the Philly Codefest 2016. Expect to see more Unity repositories.*
